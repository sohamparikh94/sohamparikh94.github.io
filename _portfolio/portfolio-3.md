Flipkart is an e-commerce platform based in India. During my internship, I worked on the task of synonym generation to augment query search results. I trained and experimented with different Word2Vec and Para2Vec models on ~1GB of textual data collected from Flipkart search queries. Implemented an analogy-based approach to predict synoynms and obtained a recall of 0.63 on a manually curated gold set. The model could recognize word-level as well as phrase-level synonyms.
