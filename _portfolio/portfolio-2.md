[Passage AI](https://passage.ai) is a startup focusing on building a conversational AI platform. My project was to build a tool for generating utterances from knowledge-base articles from scratch. The tool uses paraphrase generation, text summarization and question generation along with a novel candidate selection algorithm to select relevant utterances, which are further curated by analysts. Human evaluation on 100 articles showed that the tool generates 6 relevant per article on an average.
