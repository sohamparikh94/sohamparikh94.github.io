We present a prototype of an interface with faceted-search where the user can specify a condition and browse through treatments and outcomes that have been evaluated, specifically for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) describing individual studies. My contribution towards this project was to train a sequence labeling model for identifying the Patient, Intervention and Outcomes spans from abstract of medical publications and conduct pilot studies to analyze its generalization ability on existing publications.
